# Classroom Control Project

This project is a microservices-based application developed with **Spring Boot**, utilizing **Kafka**, **MongoDB**, and deployed on **Kubernetes**. Its primary goal is to efficiently manage access to virtual classrooms.

## General Description
The application allows:
- Creating, deleting, listing, and pausing classrooms via an API.
- Generating a dynamic queue for each created classroom, allowing users to join the queue automatically if the classroom is full.
- Scheduling the automatic eviction of the classroom after a set period (configurable via the `room.duration` variable).

## Key Technologies
- **Spring Boot** - Backend development with a modular and scalable approach.
- **Kafka** - Efficient event handling and concurrency management using partitions.
- **MongoDB** - Database for persisting classroom and user information.
- **Kubernetes** - Orchestration and deployment of microservices in a distributed environment.
- **Testcontainers** - Integration testing with real MongoDB and Kafka instances.
- **Prometheus and Grafana** - Monitoring system metrics and custom events.

## Key Technical Aspects

### 1. Dynamic Kafka Topics and Listeners Management
- When a classroom is created, the system automatically generates:
  - A **topic** to manage the queue for that classroom.
  - A **listener** associated with that topic.
- If the classroom becomes full or is paused, the listener temporarily stops consuming messages. If the listener was processing a message when paused, the process is rolled back, and the offset is not committed, ensuring the message is processed once the classroom resumes.
- When a classroom is deleted:
  - The **topic** and its **listener** are also deleted.

### 2. Listener State Persistence
- If a pod restarts, listeners are restored to the same state the classroom was in (paused or active).

### 3. Concurrency Management
- To enable concurrent user processing, classroom topics are created with **multiple partitions**. This improves performance but means message order is not guaranteed.

### 4. Stress Testing
- Added a dedicated endpoint to add 1000 users to a queue, evaluating the application's performance and scalability.

### 5. Automated Testing
- Unit and integration tests were implemented using **Testcontainers**, simulating real MongoDB and Kafka instances.

### 6. Monitoring and Observability
- Integrated with **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to:
  - Visualize performance metrics, including a custom metric: `kafka.message.latency`.
  - Monitor latency times, topic activity, and message consumption.
- Added **AKHQ** as a client to manage Kafka topics, consumer groups, and other critical components.

## Project Execution
1. Deploy the environment with Kubernetes using the provided deployment files.
3. Access the monitoring tools:
   - **Prometheus** on port `9090`
   - **Grafana** on port `3000`
   - **AKHQ** for Kafka management
